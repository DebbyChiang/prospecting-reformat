{"name":"Prospect Data Cleaning","tagline":"For Revivn","body":"#The Problem\r\nAt Revivn, I was tasked with cleaning thousands of rows of prospecting data gathered by me and previous interns using the Salesloft Google Extension. This data was exported as csv file.\r\n\r\nI specifically wanted to address the following manual processes:\r\n* Reformatting the data to fit Revivn's preferences for easily keeping track of prospects and initiating email campaigns\r\n* Categorizing prospects by Department as IT, Executives, or HR\r\n* Verifying unconfirmed emails as working\r\n\r\n#The Solution\r\nI split the scripting project into 3 separate files addressing each of the problems specified above. The script, reformat.py, changed the order of the columns of data. The script, department.py, categorized each prospect by Department based on the prospect's job title. The script, emails.py, utilized the FullContact API to verify emails.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of my internship, I converted Revivn to LeadFuze for prospecting. LeadFuze gathers and exports information slightly differently than Salesloft, so I modified the scripts as needed to process verified prospects, unverified prospects, and prospects missing emails. One difference is that the data that is exported from LeadFuze does not have a column in the csv file categorizing whether or not an emails is verified, but you can export verified, unverified, and missing emails as separate files from the LeadFuze dashboard.\r\n\r\n#Room for Improvement\r\n* Making the code more concise \r\n* Filling in the Email Type column for the green and orange email files\r\n* Writing code to automatically fill in missing emails based on data already gathered\r\n* Merging the data from 3 separate files into 1 file\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
